The Dataset file is about campus recuritment data in which there are 216 entries of employees specialized in Marketing and HR and Marketing and Finance section. It contains the HSC and SSC percentage, any prior work experience and whether they are placed or not. Based on these factors I've tried to predict the placement status of the student. The datset was taken from kaggle site.
